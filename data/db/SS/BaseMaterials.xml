      <Name>Sand:  general UK, mixture of land won, marine, secondary and recycled, bulk, loose</Name>
      <Category>Aggregates and Sand</Category>
      <Description>This is an estimate of a market average aggregate. It models a mixture of 64.2% land won, 27.5% recycled and secondary, and 8.3% marine aggregates. Consumption statistics have been taken from a report, by British Marine Aggregates Producer Association, a member of the  Mineral Products Association (MPA). [Tenth sustainable development report for the British marine aggregate industry, Dec 2016]. These results are sensitive to the embodied carbon of secondary aggregates, which is a material where data would benefit from improvement. If you know the specific type of aggregates you will use, then it is recommended to use a more specific category of aggregates.</Description>

      <Category>Aggregates and Sand</Category>
      <Description>Excludes recycled and secondary aggregate. This has been modelled with 89% land won and 11% marine won aggregate. Consumption statistics have been taken from a report, by British Marine Aggregates Producer Association, a member of the  Mineral Products Association (MPA). [Tenth sustainable development report for the British marine aggregate industry, Dec 2016].  The consumption of marine aggregate was taken to be the total marine aggregate production. Of the total, 68% are consumed in the GB market, 11% are sent to the European market and 21% used as beach replenishment or fill.</Description>

      <Description>Consumption statistics have been taken from a report, by British Marine Aggregates Producer Association, a member of the  Mineral Products Association (MPA). [Tenth sustainable development report for the British marine aggregate industry, Dec 2016].  The consumption of marine aggregate was taken to be the total marine aggregate production. The data has been modelled with the average energy consumption for extracting marine aggregates in the UK. The original data did not use all scope emissions factors, instead just scope 1 and 2. The data was therefore used to estimate the full scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The impacts to produce aggregates has a particularly large variation in embodied impacts. </Description>

      <Description>Including blast furnace slag, bottom ashes, road planings, mining spoil and other aggregates manufacturered from secondary resources. Limited data on the embodied carbon of secondary aggregates was available. There was also limited data on the consumption mixture of secondary aggregates in the UK. The mixture was estimated based upon two sub-regional reports for the Aggregate Minerals survey2015 (AM15). See the references [Table 6.1 in Ref: North East Aggregates Working Party, Annual Aggregates Monitoring report 2015, Dec 2016 ] and [Table 10B in South East Aggregates Working Party, South East Aggregates Monitoring report 2014 &amp; 2015, Sept 2016]. The data would benefit from covering a wider share of the UK secondary aggregate market,</Description>

      <Description>Bitumen with 3.5% SBS polymer. Polymer modified bitumen has a higher embodied carbon due to the higher impact of the polymer. However, the use of a polymer in asphalt mixtures is considered to increase the road lifetime. There wasn't sufficient evidence to place the additional lifetime in numbers. Further research would be needed. PMB is therefore best judged on a whole life basis.  Source: Eurobitume, 2012.

      <Description>It is strongly recommended to avoid selecting a 'general' value for concrete. Selecting data for a specific cement content in the concrete type will give much greater accuracy.  Data from EPD-RMC-20180095-CBG1-EN, for average UK concrete, produced by the British Ready-Mixed Concrete Association (BRMCA) part of the Mineral Products Association (MPA). Concrete mixture is 200kg CEM I, 95 kg ggbs, 15 kg fly ash, 1915kg aggregate, 139 kg water and 1.55 kg admixture.  </Description>

      <Description>Estimated from ICE Cement, Mortar, Concrete model with an estimate of realistic cement contents, not minimum cement contents. More cement is often added into a mixture, e.g. to cure quicker. Concrete has a wide variation of cement contents for the same strength class of concrete.   This adds additional uncertainty to this data by strength class. There is no substitute for finding out the actual cement content used in a mixture (not specified min cement content - actual cement content used by the contractor).

      <Category>Concrete</Category>
      <Description>Estimated from ICE Cement, Mortar, Concrete model with an estimate of realistic cement contents, not minimum cement contents. More cement is often added into a mixture, e.g. to cure quicker. Concrete has a wide variation of cement contents for the same strength class of concrete.   This adds additional uncertainty to this data by strength class. There is no substitute for finding out the actual cement content used in a mixture (not specified min cement content - actual cement content used by the contractor). The cement content for your mixture at this strength class might be a very different value than assumed here.</Description>

More cement is often added into a mixture, e.g. to cure quicker. Concrete has a wide variation of cement contents for the same strength class of concrete.   This adds additional uncertainty to this data by strength class. There is no substitute for finding out the actual cement content used in a mixture (not specified min cement content - actual cement content used by the contractor). The cement content for your mixture at this strength class might be a very different value than assumed here.</Description>

      <Description>Estimated from ICE Cement, Mortar, Concrete model with an estimate of realistic cement contents, not minimum cement contents. More cement is often added into a mixture, e.g. to cure quicker. Concrete has a wide variation of cement contents for the same strength class of concrete.   This adds additional uncertainty to this data by strength class. There is no substitute for finding out the actual cement content used in a mixture (not specified min cement content - actual cement content used by the contractor). The cement content for your mixture at this strength class might be a very different value than assumed here.</Description>

      <Category>Concrete</Category>
      <Description>Estimated from ICE Cement, Mortar, Concrete model with an estimate of realistic cement contents, not minimum cement contents. More cement is often added into a mixture, e.g. to cure quicker. Concrete has a wide variation of cement contents for the same strength class of concrete.   This adds additional uncertainty to this data by strength class. There is no substitute for finding out the actual cement content used in a mixture (not specified min cement content - actual cement content used by the contractor). The cement content for your mixture at this strength class might be a very different value than assumed here.</Description>

      <Description>World average steel. UO pipe is usually large in diameter and produced one piece at a time by forming plates. The plate is first pressed into a U shape by the U-press, and then into an O shape by the O-press. Because relatively thick material is used for making UO pipes, submerged arc welding is used for joining. UO pipe is mainly used as line pipe for transporting petroleum and natural gas in large quantity over long distances. System expansion was used on the steel, e.g. for blast furnace slag and other co-products. The influence of system expansion to the GWP for steel products is 3 to 7% lower GWP. At an EOL recovery rate of 85%. Module D impact of -1.35 kg CO2e per kg ('-' magnitude is a benefit, '+' magnitude a burden). This gives a net life cycle inc Mod D, of 1.67 kg CO2e per kg.</Description>

It can be found on the market in coil or in sheets and is further processed into finished products by the manufacturers. Finished Cold-rolled Steel features excellent forming properties, electromagnetic properties, paintability, weldability, and is suitable for fabrication by forming, pressing and bending. Applications include domestic applications, automotive applications, lighting fixtures, electrical components (stators, rotors) and various kinds of sections roofing applications, profiled sheets, wall elements, etc. Typical thickness between 0.3 - 3 mm. Typical width between 600 - 2100 mm. System expansion was used on the steel, e.g. for blast furnace slag and other co-products. The influence of system expansion to the GWP for steel products is 3 to 7% lower GWP.  Contact Worldsteel for more information. At an EOL recovery rate of 85%. Module D impact of -1.34 kg CO2e per kg ('-' magnitude is a benefit, '+' magnitude a burden). This gives a net life cycle inc Mod D, of 1.39 kg CO2e per kg.</Description>
