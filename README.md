The current version holds a solid set of tools to use EPDs (Environmental Product Declarations) or customised materials to calculate your embodied carbon. 
As a standalone application you can set quantities and materials,  or you can use a 3d model from Revit to import your building into the calculator. Your revit materials will automatically be mapped to to the CarboLifeCalc's own, thus giving you an instant result on the building's embodied carbon.

Roadmap:
1. EPD import possibility, using a new menu it can convert volume based data to mass based data used in CarboLifeCalc
2. Load materials from an on-line database, use material editor to save and sync to template.
3. Feedback calculation back into Revit to visualise the embodied carbon using a colour override.
4. Carbon sequestering calculator in the material editor
