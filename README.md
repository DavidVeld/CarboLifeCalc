# CarboLifeCalc

**CarboLifeCalc** is a free and open-source embodied carbon calculator for the built environment. It transforms material quantities into meaningful carbon metrics using environmental product declarations (EPDs) and other carbon data sources—giving you near-instant feedback on the environmental impact of your design.



## Key Features

- Calculates embodied carbon from material quantities
- Supports data from EPDs and carbon databases
- Works with **Autodesk Revit**
- Compatible with **Rhino Grasshopper**
- Visualizes carbon footprint with charts and heatmaps
- Exports results in CSV and JSON formats (Raw date, OneClickLCA, ItructE 3.0 or LCAx)
- Open-source and community-driven
- Works as a stand alone application
- Works within the Revit Viewer, thus a revit Licence is not required for the data extraction



## How It Works (3 Steps)

### 1. **Connect Your Design**
- Link your project from Autodesk Revit or Rhino Grasshopper.
- Automatically extract material quantities from your building model.

### 2. **Map Materials to Carbon Data**
- Match materials to embodied carbon values using EPDs or built-in databases.
- Customize or import your own datasets as needed.

### 3. **Analyze and Export Results**
- View real-time visual feedback including charts, summaries, and color-coded heatmaps.
- Export your results for reporting or further analysis.



## Why Use CarboLifeCalc?

- Raise awareness of embodied carbon in design decisions.
- Support sustainable building practices.
- Integrate seamlessly into your existing design workflow.
- Access a powerful tool without licensing fees.
